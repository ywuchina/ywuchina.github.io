<h1 id="EnrollmentInformations">Enrollment Informations:</h1>
<p>I recruit 4-7 graduate students and 3-5 undergraduates annually in the field of Computer Science and Technology (top 0.1% in ESI). Students who are interested in artificial intelligence theory and applications, computational intelligence, 3D vision, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision are welcome to contact and inquire. Additionally, my research team has several openings for graduate students. You are welcome to join us!</p>
<p><b>Team Lab Research Profile</b></p>
<p>Three-dimensional visual channel is one of the important ways for human brain to obtain information. Three-dimensional vision technology, which is centered on scene analysis and perception and understanding in three-dimensional space, is one of the important research directions of the new generation of artificial intelligence frontiers. We live in three-dimensional space, so how to intelligently perceive and explore the external environment has been a hot topic. Two-dimensional vision technology has achieved beyond human cognition with the help of powerful computer vision and deep learning algorithms, but three-dimensional vision still faces problems such as algorithmic modeling and environment dependence, and has been at the forefront of ongoing research. However, 3D information can reflect the state of objects and environment more realistically and is closer to human perception mode. In recent years, our lab team has been developing rapidly based on <a href= "https://cois.xidian.edu.cn/index.htm" target="_blank">the Key Laboratory of Collaborative Intelligent Systems of the Ministry of Education, Xidian University. </a>Based on the core technology of artificial intelligence, the team has launched scientific research in the field of 3D vision, focusing on solving its core problems such as scene analysis, semantic understanding, and collaborative optimization. In the process, the team has achieved a series of scientific research results with international influence. Our team publishes more than 20 papers every year in top international journals and conferences, such as IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TVCG, IEEE TEVC, AAAI, ACM MM, CVPR.</p>
<p><b>We Are Looking For Students Who:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Have a profound interest in Artificial Intelligence, enjoy conducting in-depth research, and are motivated by more than just the acquisition of a diploma or degree.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Are determined to pursue scientific research work after graduation.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Exhibit a spirit of exploration and are not discouraged by challenges
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Possess strong English language skills.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Physically and mentally healthy and active.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
        Are mature thinkers with ideals and aspirations.
    </li>
    
</ul>

<br>
<!--<p><b>Requirements for Admission of PhD Students:</b>
<p>The MSc students in our team have all demonstrated strong research capabilities, and many of them aspire to be promoted to PhD in their second year. However, due to the scarcity and preciousness of PhD places, we have to face the reality that even outstanding students who have published as first author in top international journals or conferences may not be able to secure a PhD place in our team. For applicants from outside universities who are interested in joining our team to pursue a PhD degree, we have set a clear criterion: at least one paper published as the first author in international conferences or journals recognized as Class A by the China Computer Federation or in the first division by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We have also set a requirement that all applicants from outside universities should have a PhD degree in a top international journal or conference. This requirement aims to ensure that our team's PhD cohort consists of members with outstanding research capabilities. If you meet the above criteria and are eager to join our research team, we encourage you to get in touch with us as soon as possible. We offer PhD students a generous package and a wealth of resources to support your academic development and professional growth. We are looking forward to your joining us to promote the development and progress of the 3D visualization field and explore the boundaries of knowledge! </p>
<p><b>How and When to Apply:</b></p>
<ul>
     <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
      If you are ready to take your passion for computer science to the next level, please reach out to us for more information and to express your interest. Contact us at <a href="mailto:ywu@xidian.edu.cn">ywu[at]xidian.edu.cn</a> to learn more about the application process and how you can become a part of our thriving research team.
     </li>
     <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5;">
      If you are eligible for guaranteed research, we recommend that you start contacting us in June to July of the second semester of your junior year. We will conduct an assessment in July-August to ensure that you will be able to join our research team. Please note that due to the large number of applicants each year, places for exempted postgraduate students are usually booked out by early August. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you contact us as early as possible to avoid missing out on valuable opportunities. For students interested in pursuing a PhD degree, we usually finalize the list of students who will enroll in September of the following year by November. Given the limited number of places available, we recommend that you prepare well in advance and contact us as early as possible to increase the success rate of your application. We look forward to your joining us and growing with you!
